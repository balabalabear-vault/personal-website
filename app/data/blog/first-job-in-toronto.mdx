# Next Goal: Terraform Associate

Mannn, I finally got an offer as an Intermediate Frontend Engineer after I arrived Toronto for almost 7 months.
It's such a huge relief to me as I thought my career is going to get bombed.
Getting my first job in Canada means a lot to me. Not just a pay check, but more importantly, an indicator to show I do have some value in this industry.
I really appreciate to those who are involved and facilitated during the process. THANK YOU SO MUCCCCH!!!
Even though they won't even notice about this message XD

Anyway, I got a job now. Apart from exceling at my work, I also need to start equipping myself to prevent such disaster happens on me again.
Finishing the [Terraform Associate Certificate](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003) is what I need to be done before the end of 2024. 

So pleasee Jack Kwok, Hang On Tight.
