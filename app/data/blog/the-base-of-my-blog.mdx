# The Base of My Blog - Markdown

I think Markdown is a brilliant tool as it is lightweight but still formattable and be able to render in multiple palces.
Yet, I believe not every programmer knows it's syntax for documentation, at least I don't.
Therefore, I am going to implement Markdown throughout all my blogs to let me acquire a better documentaiton skill.
 
In this post, I am going to show how I enable Markdown rendering in this Next project. Most of my content will be covered in [Next Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) though.

### STEP 1: Installation
I am using yarn in this project. Therefore, I am going to use yarn as my command. Feel free to use others like npm.

Basic installation:

```
yarn add @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx
```

If you want to use it in slug page:

```
yarn add next-mdx-remote
```

### STEP 2: TypeScript Config
If you are using TypeScript, you may encounter the folowing error:
<img src="/blog/mdx-type-error.png" alt="drawing" style={{ width: '80vw'}}/>

In this case, you need to add the following ts declaration in your types directory suggested by [MDXjs](https://v0.mdxjs.com/advanced/typescript).
```
declare module '*.mdx' {
    let MDXComponent: (props) => JSX.Element;
    export default MDXComponent;
}
```
---
### STEP 3: TypeScript Config
Create an mdx-components.tsx file in the root of the project to define global MDX Components.
```
import type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types';
export function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {
  return ({
    ...components,
  })
}
```
---
### Step 4: Done!
Setup-wise I think that's all!

Remeber to use <code>`<MDXRemote />`</code> from ```next-mdx-remote/rsc``` if you want to use it in a slug page.

See you next time, ciao!
